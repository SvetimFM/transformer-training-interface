# Training Chart Reset and Enhanced Tail Validation

## Summary

Two key improvements to the training system:

1. **Chart Reset on Training Start**: Loss charts now automatically clear when starting a new training session
2. **Enhanced Tail Validation**: Validation occurs 5x more frequently during the last 20% of training

## Features

### 1. Chart Reset
- Training/validation loss charts clear when clicking "Start Training"
- Previous completion messages are hidden
- Each training session starts with a clean visualization
- No confusion from overlapping data from different runs

### 2. Enhanced Tail Phase Validation

#### Configuration
- `tail_ratio: 0.2` - Last 20% of training (increased from 10%)
- `tail_eval_multiplier: 5` - Validate 5x more frequently in tail

#### Behavior
- **Normal Phase (0-80%)**: Validation every 500 steps (default)
- **Tail Phase (80-100%)**: Validation every 100 steps
- **Result**: 80% more validation points overall

#### Example (10,000 steps)
- Steps 0-500: Warmup phase
- Steps 500-8000: Main training (15 validations)
- Steps 8000-10000: Fine polish tail (20 validations)
- Total: 36 validations vs 20 without tail acceleration

## Benefits

### Better Fine-Tuning Monitoring
- Critical final 20% of training has 5x more validation points
- Catch overfitting earlier in the fine-tuning phase
- Better visibility into model convergence
- More data points for learning rate decay effectiveness

### Cleaner Visualization
- Each training run starts fresh
- No accumulated data from previous runs
- Clear progression tracking
- Easier to compare different training configurations

## Visual Indicators

1. **Phase Display**: Shows "Fine Polish (Tail 20%)" during final phase
2. **Validation Frequency**: Visible increase in validation points on chart
3. **LR Schedule**: Tail phase clearly marked on learning rate diagram

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic Validation Interval
```python
tail_start_step = int(total_steps * (1 - config.tail_ratio))
is_tail_phase = global_step >= tail_start_step

if is_tail_phase:
    current_eval_interval = max(1, config.eval_interval // config.tail_eval_multiplier)
else:
    current_eval_interval = config.eval_interval
```

### Chart Reset
```javascript
function resetChart() {
    lossChart.data.labels = [];
    lossChart.data.datasets[0].data = [];
    lossChart.data.datasets[1].data = [];
    lossChart.update('none');
}
```

## Usage

1. Start training - chart automatically clears
2. Monitor normal validation during first 80%
3. Watch validation frequency increase at 80% mark
4. Observe detailed fine-tuning progress in tail phase
5. Make informed decisions about early stopping

The enhanced tail validation provides crucial insights during the most delicate phase of training where the model transitions from learning broad patterns to fine-tuning specific details.
