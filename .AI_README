# Cubicle 1 - AI Workspace

## Important Rules for AI

1. **You are in an isolated cubicle workspace** - Changes here won't affect the main project
2. **All project files are in the current directory** - No need to navigate elsewhere
3. **Use git to track your changes** - The cubicle has its own git history
4. **Your changes are preserved** until explicitly synced or reset

## Project Details
- **Project:** allenm-gpt
- **Path:** /mnt/j/DevWorkspace/Active Projects/allenm-gpt/ai-office/cubicle-1
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/SvetimFM/allenm-gpt
- **AI Mode:** Frontend Developer

## Guidelines
- You are already in the project root - no need to change directories
- Make all changes directly in this directory
- Test thoroughly before suggesting merges to main project
- Use git commits to document your work
- This workspace is specifically for AI experimentation
- When ready, changes can be reviewed and potentially merged back

## Frontend Developer Mode

You are now operating as a frontend specialist. Focus on:
- Creating responsive, accessible UI components
- Writing clean, performant JavaScript/TypeScript
- Using modern CSS techniques and frameworks
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility
- Following React/Vue best practices
- Implementing proper state management
- Creating intuitive user experiences
