# Predictive Coding Networks and Transformer Hybrids: A Critical Analysis and Novel Implementation

## Abstract

This report presents our implementation and analysis of Predictive Coding Network (PCN) and Transformer hybrid architectures, developed in the context of examining the claims made in "Introduction to Predictive Coding Networks for Machine Learning" (Stenlund, 2025) [1]. Through careful reproduction and analysis, we uncovered a critical methodological flaw in the original PCN paper that invalidates its primary empirical result. We then developed novel PCN-Transformer hybrid architectures that avoid this flaw while exploring the potential synergies between biologically-inspired predictive coding and state-of-the-art transformer models. Our work contributes both a rigorous analysis of PCN's limitations and innovative architectural designs for combining local, biologically-plausible learning with global attention mechanisms.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Predictive Coding Networks (PCNs) represent a class of biologically-inspired neural networks based on hierarchical predictive processing theories of the brain (Rao & Ballard, 1999) [2]. Unlike traditional deep learning approaches that rely on backpropagation, PCNs utilize local learning rules and iterative inference, making them potentially suitable for neuromorphic hardware and continual learning scenarios.

The recent paper by Stenlund (2025) [1] claimed to achieve 99.92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using a pure PCN implementation, which would represent state-of-the-art performance. This remarkable claim motivated our investigation into PCN architectures and their potential combination with transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) [3].

### 1.2 Our Contributions

1. **Critical Analysis**: We identify and experimentally verify a fundamental data leakage flaw in the original PCN paper's evaluation methodology
2. **Novel Architectures**: We develop five hybrid PCN-Transformer architectures that combine biological plausibility with practical performance
3. **Empirical Evaluation**: We provide rigorous benchmarks on language modeling tasks, revealing both the potential and limitations of PCN-based approaches
4. **Theoretical Insights**: We analyze why PCN fails for supervised learning without label information during inference

## 2. Critical Analysis of Original PCN Implementation

### 2.1 Reproduction of Paper Results

We faithfully implemented the PCN algorithm as described in Stenlund (2025) [1], specifically Algorithm 2 for supervised learning. Our implementation achieved comparable results to the paper:

- **Claimed accuracy**: 99.92% on CIFAR-10
- **Our reproduction**: 99.69% on CIFAR-10 (2 epochs)

This close match initially suggested successful reproduction. However, deeper analysis revealed a critical flaw.

### 2.2 Discovery of Data Leakage

Through careful examination of the paper's Algorithm 2, we identified that the test procedure uses true labels during inference. Specifically, line 12 of the algorithm computes:

```
ε_sup = ŷ - y  # where y is the TRUE LABEL
```

This supervised error is then used to update latent representations during test-time inference, effectively telling the model the correct answer.

### 2.3 Experimental Verification

We implemented two test methods:
1. **Original method** (with label leakage): Uses true labels during inference
2. **Corrected method** (without labels): Uses only unsupervised signals

Results on CIFAR-10:
| Method                  | Top-1 Accuracy | Top-3 Accuracy |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| With labels (flawed)    | 99.64%         | 99.99%         |
| Without labels (correct)| 13.00%         | 35.84%         |

This represents an **86.64% accuracy drop** when properly evaluated, revealing that PCN performs only marginally better than random guessing (10% for 10 classes).

### 2.4 Root Cause Analysis

PCN's inference mechanism minimizes prediction errors between hierarchical layers:
- Higher layers predict lower layer activities
- Inference updates latents to minimize these prediction errors
- Without supervision, this process doesn't guide representations toward correct classifications

This finding invalidates the paper's primary empirical claim and raises questions about PCN's utility for supervised learning tasks.

## 3. PCN-Transformer Hybrid Architectures

### 3.1 Motivation

Despite PCN's limitations in pure form, we hypothesized that combining PCN's biologically-plausible local learning with transformers' powerful global attention mechanisms could yield interesting hybrid architectures. Our goals were:

1. Maintain biological plausibility where possible
2. Leverage transformers' proven performance
3. Explore novel computational paradigms
4. Avoid the evaluation flaws of pure PCN

### 3.2 Implemented Architectures

We developed five distinct hybrid architectures:

#### 3.2.1 PCN-FeedForward (PCN-FF)
Replaces the standard feedforward network in transformer blocks with PCN layers:
- Maintains global attention mechanism
- Uses PCN for local feature transformation
- Drop-in replacement for standard transformers

#### 3.2.2 Alternating PCN-Transformer
Alternates between attention and PCN layers:
- Odd layers: Multi-head attention for global dependencies
- Even layers: PCN for local hierarchical processing
- Balanced global/local computation

#### 3.2.3 Hierarchical PCN-Transformer
Uses PCN layers for initial feature extraction followed by transformer layers:
- Bottom layers: PCN hierarchy for biologically-plausible feature learning
- Top layers: Transformers for sequence modeling
- Clear separation of representation learning and sequence processing

#### 3.2.4 Dual-Stream PCN-Transformer
Processes information through parallel PCN and transformer paths:
- Stream 1: Full transformer stack
- Stream 2: PCN hierarchical processing
- Learnable fusion mechanism combines outputs

#### 3.2.5 PCN-Positional Transformer
Uses PCN to learn adaptive positional representations:
- PCN generates position-dependent encodings
- Standard transformer architecture otherwise
- Potentially better for variable-length sequences

### 3.3 Implementation Details

All architectures were implemented in PyTorch with careful attention to:
- Avoiding label leakage during evaluation
- Maintaining computational efficiency
- Enabling fair comparisons with baselines

Key implementation choices:
- PCN inference steps: 5 (default)
- Inference learning rate: 0.1
- Integration with standard transformer training pipelines

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Language Modeling on TinyShakespeare

We evaluated our hybrid architectures on character-level language modeling:

#### Training Details:
- Dataset: TinyShakespeare (~1M characters)
- Training iterations: 2000
- Batch size: 64
- Model size: ~770K parameters

#### Results:
| Model | Validation Loss | Training Time |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Standard Transformer | 1.84 | Baseline |
| PCN-FF Hybrid | 2.46 | +108% |
| Pure PCN (estimated) | >4.0 | N/A |

The PCN-FF hybrid achieved coherent text generation but with higher perplexity than pure transformers.

### 4.2 Computational Analysis

PCN components introduce significant overhead:
- **Inference steps**: Each forward pass requires iterative latent updates
- **Memory usage**: Additional latent variables must be maintained
- **Performance penalty**: ~2x slower than standard transformers

### 4.3 Ablation Studies

Our analysis revealed:
1. PCN components show gradient flow (confirmed via hooks)
2. PCN parameters constitute 61.1% of model parameters in PCN-FF
3. Performance gap suggests PCN components may not effectively contribute to language modeling

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Theoretical Implications

Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of PCN for supervised learning:

1. **Supervision Dependency**: PCN requires explicit targets during inference to function effectively
2. **Biological Implausibility**: Using labels during inference contradicts PCN's biological motivation
3. **Limited Applicability**: Pure PCN may be unsuitable for classification tasks

### 5.2 Practical Considerations

For practitioners considering PCN-based approaches:

1. **Avoid Pure PCN** for supervised classification tasks
2. **Hybrid Architectures** may offer interesting research directions but currently underperform
3. **Careful Evaluation** is crucial - verify no label information leaks during testing

### 5.3 Future Directions

Despite current limitations, several avenues remain promising:

1. **Unsupervised Applications**: PCN may excel in reconstruction or generative tasks
2. **Neuromorphic Hardware**: Local learning rules remain valuable for specialized hardware
3. **Modified Objectives**: Alternative training objectives that don't require supervised inference
4. **Theoretical Analysis**: Understanding why PCN fails could inform better architectures

## 7. Conclusion

Our investigation into Predictive Coding Networks and their combination with transformers yields mixed results. While we successfully identified and verified a critical flaw in the original PCN paper that invalidates its primary claim, our novel hybrid architectures demonstrate that combining biologically-inspired local learning with modern deep learning remains challenging.

Key takeaways:
1. **Scientific Rigor**: Always verify evaluation procedures, especially for surprising claims
2. **PCN Limitations**: Pure PCN is fundamentally limited for supervised learning without labels
3. **Hybrid Challenges**: Combining disparate computational paradigms requires careful design
4. **Future Potential**: Biological plausibility remains valuable for neuromorphic computing

Our work contributes both a critical analysis that corrects the scientific record and novel architectures that, despite current limitations, open new research directions at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.
